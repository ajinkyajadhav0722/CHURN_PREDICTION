                                                     Churn Prediction Analysis


I explore a telecommunications dataset to forecast customer churn, a vital aspect of customer relationship management. I employ advanced machine learning techniques like Decision Trees, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Random Forest Classifier, achieving an impressive predictive accuracy of 95%. Decision Trees provide intuitive insights into the factors influencing churn behavior, while PCA helps in reducing data dimensionality, enhancing computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the Random Forest Classifier improves prediction accuracy by aggregating multiple decision trees. This analysis underscores the critical role of machine learning in proactive churn management within the telecommunications industry, enabling companies to anticipate and address customer attrition effectively. Leveraging these insights, telecom providers can implement targeted retention strategies, optimize customer engagement, and foster long-term customer loyalty and business sustainability.
